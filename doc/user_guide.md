<a name="def-list-apps"></a>
#### List of applications
Look at the vertical menu on the left and click on the My Applications option. Here you can see the application in which you are authorized. You can also select one of the organizations to which the user belongs and show all its applications.

<a name="def-register-app"></a>
#### Register an application
In home page, in the Applications section you can register new application by clicking on "Register". You can also register an application from My Application page.
<a name="def-fig2"></a>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ging/fiware-idm/master/doc/resources/UserGuide_homepage2.png)

Click on "Next" ([Figure 7](#def-fig7)).

In the second step the application's logo will be loaded by selecting a valid file type. You have the option to re-frame the chosen image.

Click on "Crop Image" when you complete this process and then click "Next" as shown on [Figure 9](#def-fig9).

<a name="def-application-info"></a>
#### Show application
Once you have created an application, you are redirected to the page where all the information is displayed. You can also access this information by clicking in the corresponding application from the My Applications page. The Oauth2 credentials of the application are displayed in this page.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ging/fiware-idm/master/doc/resources/UserGuide_application_show.png)
<p align="center">Figure 15: Application view</p>

You can also perform several actions:

 - Edit the application. Here you can change applications attributes: name, description, url, redirect_uri and logo.
 - Manage roles. Explained in the previous section.
 - Register a Pep Proxy.
 - Register an Iot Agent.
 - Authorize users.
 - Authorize organizations.

<a name="def-register-pep-and-iot"></a>
#### Register Pep Proxy and Iot Agents
For each application you can register a Pep Proxy in order to enable authentication and authorization via Oauth2. You can also register some IoT agents in the application to provide lightweight security mechanisms to yours IoT devices.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ging/fiware-idm/master/doc/resources/UserGuide_register_pep_iot.png)
<p align="center">Figure 16: Pep Proxy and Iot Agents register</p>

You can also reset passwords of this  components or delete them.
<a name="def-authorize"></a>
#### Authorize users and organizations

You can add users or organizations in the application by clicking on the "Authorize" button.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ging/fiware-idm/master/doc/resources/UserGuide_authorize.png)
<p align="center">Figure 17: KeyRock authorize</p>
It shows a modal where you can manage Users and Groups. You can see the users or organizations and their initially assigned roles. You can search users or organizations in the right column. Note that you can assign roles after the user or organization have been added, by clicking on the roles drop down menu - below the user's icon, as shown on Figure 18 and Figure 19.

When you assign roles to an organization, you assign it to the users who are owners or memebers of the application. In next section is explained more in detail how to manage organizations.

<a name="def-trusted"></a>
#### Authorize trusted applications

When validating permissions in [Keyrock's built-in PDP](http://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin_guide/#authorization) as explained [here](http://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/#def-validate-auth) the application in which the permission was created and assigned to the user is checked. 

Keyrock allows application owners to trust in other applications. Thus, a PDP check will validate if the user has an specific permission in the current application or in one of the applications in which it trusts. For adding trusted applications you can use the API or the web interface:
